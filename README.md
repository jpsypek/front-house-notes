# House Notes

House Notes is an online resource for all roommates of a home to keep track of any groceries that are needed or errands that need to be done around the house. This application was built with React utilizing a RESTful API built with Ruby on Rails and a Postgres database.

## Getting Started

1. git clone the backend repository (https://github.com/jpsypek/back-house-notes)
2. run rails db:create to create the Postgres db
3. run rails db:seed to seed the db
4. run rails s to run the backend server
5. git clone the frontend repository (https://github.com/jpsypek/front-house-notes)
6. run npm start to frontend server
